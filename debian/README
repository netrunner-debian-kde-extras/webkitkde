WebKit KPart in Debian
----------------------

By default, the khtml rendering engine will take precedence over the webkit
part (this is a choice by the KDE project.)

This can be changed in the file type dialog ('keditfiletype text/html'
command, but you'll probably want to set it for a number of other MIME Types
as well), or you can set it globally by editing the file kwebkitpart.desktop
in /usr/share/kde4/services/ and setting InitialPreference to a value higher
than khtml's value (10.)
