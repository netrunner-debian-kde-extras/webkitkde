Make khml the global default
----------------------------

By default, KHTML is preferred over the WebKit KPart.

This can be changed in the file type dialog ('keditfiletype text/html' command,
but you'll probably want to set it for a number of MIME Types), or you can set
it globally by editing /usr/share/kde4/services/kwebkitpart.desktop and setting
InitialPreference to a value bigger than 10 (default is 9, khtml is 10.)
