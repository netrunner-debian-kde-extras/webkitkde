WebKit KPart is now the default
-------------------------------

By default, if installed, the KDE WebKit KPart will take precedence over the
khtml part. (This is a Debian specific change.)

This can be changed in the file type dialog ('keditfiletype text/html' command,
but you'll probably want to set it for a number of other MIME Types as well),
or you can set it globally by editing the file kwebkitpart.desktop in
/usr/share/kde4/services/ and setting InitialPreference back to its default
value 9.  khtml has InitialPreference setting of 10.
