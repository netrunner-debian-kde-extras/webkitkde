<body>
You will be redirected to <a href="http://www.kde.org">kde.org</a> in 10 seconds.<br/>
<p>
If the stop button is active (not disabled) after the page has completely loaded, it
means the rendering engine allows you to cancel &lt;META&gt; based redirect requests.
Otherwise, you are not able to stop redirects or refresh requests set by web pages.
