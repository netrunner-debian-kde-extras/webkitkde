* Add proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror kpart plugins:
    - kget         download selection and other advanced features only work
                   with KHTML and the features that work still use KHTML
                   classes resulting in two rendering engines being active
                   at one time.
    - adblock      again tight integration as available in khtml is completely
                   missing. Bonus: this functionality without modifying any code
                   inside of the kwebkitpart or the kdewebkit components.

* Add support for KPartStatusBarExtension and hence the following features:
      - Full ad-block integration (rudimentary blocking already there).
      - Popup blocker integration (completely absent now, might require upstream changes).

* Implement a means of showing the following information (Perhaps do "about:engine"?):
      - Show kwebkitpart's version number
      - Show qtwebkit's version number
      - Show KDE's version number

* Look through all of Konqueror's web configuration options and make sure we
  honor all those that we possibly can... Here is a list of options that
  currently do not work:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO, QtWebKit support required ???).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not seem to work).
      - Right click goes back in history (TODO).
      - Allow automatic delayed reloading/redirecting (QtWebKit Bug #29899).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit support required??).
      - Animations (TODO, QtWebKit support required???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (TODO, QtWebKit support required???).
