* Proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror plugins:
    - kget         Currently only downloading selected links does not work.
    - adblock      Though rudimentary ad blocking support is already there,
                   none of this plugin's advanced features work in kwebkitpart.
                   The advanced features are currently KHTML specific and need
                   to be modified to support kwebkitpart.
                   NOTE: unlike KHTML, the advanced features support can be
                   completely implemented outside of the kwebkitpart source tree.
    - webarchive   This plugin is hoplessly KHTML specific and will require
                   significant effort to add support for KWebKitPart.

* Add KPartStatusBarExtension support for the following plugins/features:
      - Popup blocker (non-plugin)

* Implement some means of showing the following information (Perhaps "about:engine"?):
      - KWebKitPart's version #
      - QtWebKit's version #
      - UserAgent string ???

* Look through all of Konqueror's web configuration options and make sure we
  honor all those we possibly can... Here is a non-complete list of options
  that currently do not work:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not work correctly).
      - Right click goes back in history (TODO).
      - Allow automatic delayed reloading/redirecting (QtWebKit Bug #29899).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Animations (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
