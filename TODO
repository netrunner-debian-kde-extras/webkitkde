* Proper support for KWebKitPart in the following Konqueror plugins:
      - kget       Only the "download selected links only" feature is not supported
                   due to deficiencies of QtWebKit. See http://webkit.org/b/48013.

      - adblock    This plugin needs to be changed to use the KPart plugin
                   extensions so that it is not KHTML specific. Otherwise,
                   kwebkitpart supports all of the ad filtering functionality
                   supported by khtml.

* Add KPartStatusBarExtension support for the following plugins/features:
      - Popup blocker (non-plugin)

* Implement some means of showing information about the webkit rendering engine:
      - KWebKitPart's version #
      - QtWebKit's version #
      - UserAgent string ???

* Look through all of Konqueror's web configuration options and make sure we
  honor all those we possibly can. Here is a non-complete list of features
  that are either partially implemented or not implemented at all:
      - Change cursor over links (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Smooth scrolling support (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Underline links support (Partial, does not work as intended).
      - Right click goes back in history (TODO).
      - Enable access key navigation with Ctrl key (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Animations (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
      - Draw frames around not completely loaded images (TODO, QtWebKit ???).
